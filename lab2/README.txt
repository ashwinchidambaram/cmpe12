Lab 2: Intro to Logic with Multimedia Logic
Section: 01D

In this lab I learned how to use the Multimedia Logic software as well as how to use the tool set provided with it. In addition to that, I learned how to use different Logic gates as well as how random number generators work on a surface level understanding. I also made the mistake of trying to receive a signal to a light from different outputs in Part C of the lab, however, I worked around it by using OR gates to condense the signal into the valid ones using a SOP approach and outputting that as a single signal.


Answer to Lab Questions:

1) If we didn't have the digital display from MML, we could possibly make it by using a combination of switches and lights much like Part B of this lab. With each flip of a switch matching itself to a binary value (2^0, 2^1, etc.) and then we could match that to a series of 8 lights that act similar to the digital display.

2 & 3) I think a random number generator works by selecting a value from a set of possible values. However, I don't believe that the "random" number that is selected is truly random, since a random number generator is created using complex logic that mimics more of a very complicated sequence that is hard to predict. As a result, I don't think we can call this a true random, but its close enough to being random for normal use.
